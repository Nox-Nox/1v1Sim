## 1v1Sim

First project in C++.
In this project I am learning and trying to understand how pointers and reference works as it is pointless coding in C++ if you don't know how to use these features which allows you to manipulate the memory and improve performance.

This is a simple player vs mob game where the player will be able to use skills to kill mobs, gain experience and fight higher level mobs with higher stats.

Objectives of this project are:
- split code between cpp and headers
- understand how and when to use pointers and references

### Development stil in progress.
